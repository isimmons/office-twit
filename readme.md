## OfficeTwit is a twitter clone built on Laravel PHP framework v 4.2
### Yes that's right. I said 4.2 
### UNSTABLE but amazingly works very well :-)

##Notes:
* cdn fallback for bootstrap

-- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7383163/how-to-fallback-to-local-stylesheet-not-script-if-cdn-fails/7452378#7452378
* Figure it out from ^ that and fix it later. Skip the fallback for now


## Official Documentation
For OfficeTwit? There is none. But I did just upload a gh-pages with twitter bootstrap theme :-)
http://isimmons.github.io/office-twit
There is no content there yet.

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
