## OfficeTwit is a twitter clone built on Laravel PHP framework v 4.2
### Yes that's right. I said 4.2 
### UNSTABLE but amazingly works very well :-)

#TODO
* Figure out how I want to implement public viewable profiles
* Allow search for public viewable profiles from user who is not logged in
* Create admin section with many configs for company IT administrator to be a Twit Nazi
* Allow user config to show own personal twitter feed side by side with company feed
* Allow user to RT personal onto company feed but not from company onto personal
* Allow company admin to enable afore mentioned retweeting of company twits onto users personal feed

##Notes:
* cdn fallback for bootstrap

-- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7383163/how-to-fallback-to-local-stylesheet-not-script-if-cdn-fails/7452378#7452378
* Figure it out from ^ that and fix it later. Skip the fallback for now


## Official Documentation
For OfficeTwit? There is none. But I did just upload a gh-pages with twitter bootstrap theme :-)
http://isimmons.github.io/office-twit
There is no content there yet.

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
