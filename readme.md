## OfficeTwit is a twitter clone built on Laravel PHP framework v 4.2
### Yes that's right. I said 4.2 
### UNSTABLE but amazingly works very well :-)

#TODO
* Go through entire project checking for SOLID principles
* Check all endpoints for security
* Do not remove the above two items until application is complete
* Figure out how I want to implement public viewable profiles
* Allow search for public viewable profiles from user who is not logged in (not sure?)
* Create admin section with many configs for company IT administrator to be a Twit Nazi
* Allow user config to show own personal twitter feed side by side with company feed
* Above reminds me, need user settings overridable by admin settings
* Allow user to RT personal onto company feed but not from company onto personal
* Allow company admin to enable afore mentioned retweeting of company twits onto users personal feed

##Notes:
* Not sure if want to list all signed up users at /users or just provide a search feature like Twitter does


## Official Documentation
For OfficeTwit? There is none. But I did just upload a gh-pages with twitter bootstrap theme :-)

There is no content there yet. Still no documentation

Documentation for the Laravel framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
